I used to copy and paste, as Hamid suggested until recently. I created a chrome extension that copies the .tex content; filters the commands/keywords and pastes the plain text in a textarea. This textarea is displayed over the pdf preview and all textareas are scanned by Grammarly.


# Instructions

  - Install nodejs
  - Inside the rootdir of this project run `npm install`
  - Load the extension as explained here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
  - Activate the plugin by clickin the plugin en enabling the checkbox.
  - Click the textarea to initialize spellcheck.
