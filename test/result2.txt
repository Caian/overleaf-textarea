The loss function used is the same as in. The loss function has two components, the bin classification component and the regression component. Bin classification uses stable softmax and cross-entropy, which helps the network predict the pose's neighborhood. N. Ruiz et al. calculated three entropy losses, one for each angle, and backpropagated it through the network to improve learning. They computed the expectation of each output angle from the binned output to obtain the fine-grained prediction. The regression loss was calculated using the Mean Square Error loss to improve the fine-grained prediction. The alpha value is a hyperparameter used for the regression loss function, and the weight of the classification loss is constant.
